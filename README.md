# Directus' OpenAPI Specification

This repo contains the OpenAPI specifications for Directus' API.

The static spec in this repo contains all the system endpoints and a definition for a generic `/items/{collection}` endpoint.

## Usage

The spec is exported in 3 formats: `.yaml`, `.json`, and `.js`. The JS file is just an `export` of the same JSON but parsed into JS for ease of use in JS projects.

## Requirements

The specification is written to work with OpenAPI version 3 and up.

## Vendor Extensions

The spec relies on two vendor-specific fields to represent information required by the system:

### `x-collection`

Key that maps a system endpoint to its corresponding system collection. 

### `x-codeSamples`

Examples of how to use the equivalent of the documented REST endpoint in the JS SDK and/or GraphQL endpoint.

## Deploying Releases

> [!NOTE]
> This requires write access to the `@directus` organization on npm

To deploy a new release to npm:

- `rm -rf dist` if it exists
- `pnpm build` to build a new `dist` folder
- `pnpm lint` to ensure the built spec is valid
- `pnpm version <patch | minor>`
- `git push && git push --tags`
- `pnpm publish`

This manual process will be replaced with a CD action, but until we set that up, follow the above :)
